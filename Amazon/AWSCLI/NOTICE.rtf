Public Domain Dedication\
========================\
\
The persons who have associated their work with this project (the\
"Dedicator": David Goodger and the many contributors to the Docutils\
project) hereby dedicate the entire copyright, less the exceptions_\
listed below, in the work of authorship known as "Docutils" identified\
below (the "Work") to the public domain.\
\
The primary repository for the Work is the Internet World Wide Web\
site <{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://docutils.sourceforge.net/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 http://docutils.sourceforge.net/}}>.\'a0 The Work consists of the\
files within the "docutils" module of the Docutils project Subversion\
repository (Internet host {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 docutils.svn.sourceforge.net}}, filesystem path\
/svnroot/docutils), whose Internet web interface is located at\
<{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/docutils/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/docutils/}}>.\'a0 Files dedicated to the\
public domain may be identified by the inclusion, near the beginning\
of each file, of a declaration of the form::\
\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Copyright: This document/module/DTD/stylesheet/file/etc. has been\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 placed in the public domain.\
\
Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large\
and to the detriment of Dedicator's heirs and successors.\'a0 Dedicator\
intends this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in\
perpetuity of all present and future rights under copyright law,\
whether vested or contingent, in the Work.\'a0 Dedicator understands that\
such relinquishment of all rights includes the relinquishment of all\
rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those copyrights in the\
Work.\
\
Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work\
may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified,\
built upon, or otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose,\
commercial or non-commercial, and in any way, including by methods\
that have not yet been invented or conceived.\

Public Domain Dedication`. [#]_)\

\'a0\'a0 recommend that it be applied to works: This tool is based on United\
